Using the subway, it took us about 50 minutes to get to Times Square, 35 minutes to get to the financial district, 1 hour 40 minutes to get to LaGuardia airport (if you take a taxi, it costs about $34). The subway station is a few blocks from the apartment, about a 10 min walk. The neighborhood seems a bit sketchy and unsafe at first, but after staying there a while (often coming back late), I've found it to be pretty safe and every night, a police car would drive around. The place is exactly as you see in pictures, water was always hot, and the heater was effective, WiFi was fast, but the only thing that was a bit of a surprise to me was that the bedroom is the only room that you can lock off as your own. The bathroom and kitchen sink area are technically left open, as you don't get a key for these places, but I assume no one is really supposed to come down while we are staying there. Also, you can definitely hear the people upstairs walking and the pipes make some noise, but it didn't bother us too much as neither of us are light sleepers and we were always dead tired when we came back from the city. All in all, had a great experience and strongly recommend staying at Silvia's, especially if you want to save money on hotels!\"}, {'_id': '3482352', 'date': datetime.datetime(2013, 2, 5, 5, 0), 'listing_id': '11708', 'reviewer_id': '4529780', 'reviewer_name': 'Adam', 'comments': \"We stayed in Silvia's apartment for 6 days.

We've never stayed in Bushwick before, usually preferring Brooklyn Heights. That area has become too pricey, so we took a chance on Bushwick, hearing it's become fun and eclectic and safer. It was all of that, plus friendly and felt safe.\\n\\nAbsolutely enjoyable area, more than enough coffee shops and restaurants to walk to, and we also walked a lot to nearby Williamsburg, with even more opportunities for great dining. \\n\\nSilvia and her family were wonderful; we enjoyed meeting her smart and charming daughter and her interesting artist husband, who maintains an art studio next-door that you can visit.\\n\\nThis basement apartment is reached through a narrow passageway in a full storage garage, which might be off-putting at first, but don't be fooled: you come down the stairs and into a clean, spacious and minimal apartment.  It is basic, but has everything you need. Extra toiletries, toaster oven, coffee maker, extra comforter, etc. \\nThere's a groovy custom-made bench and iron table to sit at for a quick snack or some sightseeing planning.\\n\\nSilvia provides a three-ring binder with neighborhood menus and house rules. Try El Kucho, just on the next block, *great* Mexican & nice owners. At this time, they have not yet received their liquor license, but about five doors down on the same spot is a great wine store.  \\nArchie's, a nearby bar and pizza spot is a great alternative to the 1-2 hour wait at famous Roberta's pizza.\\n\\nOne or two reviewers here have said that it was warm down there in the summer. The weather was cool during our visit, so we weren't too warm. The temperature was really perfect. There are two small windows in case you feel claustrophobic, but we never did. She has decorated it in a way that feels airy. At any rate, we were out of our room early and back late, enjoying Brooklyn!\\n\\nThe bed and pillows are quite firm, but we slept well. You are in a basement; expect upstairs noise. I am a very light sleeper, so I always bring earplugs; noise wasn't a problem.\\n\\nI don't see how anyone could get a better value in Brooklyn, so close to Brooklyn Heights.

The neighborhood seems a bit sketchy and unsafe at first, but after staying there a while (often coming back late), I've found it to be pretty safe and every night, a police car would drive around. The place is exactly as you see in pictures, water was always hot, and the heater was effective, WiFi was fast, but the only thing that was a bit of a surprise to me was that the bedroom is the only room that you can lock off as your own. The bathroom and kitchen sink area are technically left open, as you don't get a key for these places, but I assume no one is really supposed to come down while we are staying there. Also, you can definitely hear the people upstairs walking and the pipes make some noise, but it didn't bother us too much as neither of us are light sleepers and we were always dead tired when we came back from the city.

The studio was clean, but the stairs going up up were dusty old, dirty, dark and narrow. The street stinks like garbage, because there are lots of restaurants. The kitchinette was equipded with the bare minimum: no sharp knife, no bowls, no cutting board; only one cup of water, 2 small mugs, 4 plates and some spoons, forks and blunt knifes. The water boiler was burned, fortunately we had a microwave and a rice cooker machine. No closet or wall hangers to hang clothes or jackets. The entrance of the studio is on a narrow hallway that is pilled up with stuff under plastic bags. Next time I´ll try to look for a residential area in HK, rather than commercial to avoid the stink.

I am not saying that these are problems,  just so you know.  The description on Air B&B was accurate.  The room was spotlessly clean, quite comfortable and very well located within easy walking distance of just about everything most of us want to do in Porto.  Even though on a street populated with bars and night clubs, it was very quiet.  Parking is EXTREMELY limited/expensive and we do not recommend that you have a car in Porto.  In my estimation, driving in Porto is nothing short of dangerous for the uninitiated.  We dropped off our rental at the Porto airport and took a taxi (20 to 30 euros) from the airport to the apartment.  We returned to the airport by taxi at the end of our stay and picked up another car to complete our trip.  Just so you know, Enterprise (operated by Guerin in Portugal) was very helpful and easy to deal with.  We made reservations in advance from the US.  Good thing because they were out of cars for people who did not have advance reservations. The kitchen in the apartment was supplied with rudimentary equipment but be sure you bring your own coffee, sugar, salt, pepper, water, wine, etc.  Stove, oven , microwave, refrigerator are there.  Supermarket for supplies was a 10 minute walk from the apartment.  Two mini-markets (which I do not recommend) were 7 minutes walk away.  AC/heater worked very well and we were comfortable all the time.  Bernardo met us at the door and was VERY helpful in directing us around the old city, arranging a taxi, etc.  He was always available at nothing short of a moment's notice.

We love everything about the experience. Book the stay as soon as you can before this place gets too popular. Here is a quick summary of what we like about this place:  \\n1. super new&clean room with ocean-view: while we were looking for a place to stay that is close to Hilo, a lot of the hotels seen old and some Airbnbs look too remote (no bathroom attached). The cacao room really stood out as the room itself is excellent with oceanview. Already missed the feeling of waking up by the morning bird songs and enjoy the sunrise from the cacao room.\\n\\n2. Modern design farmhouse: The building is a piece of art. It is so interesting to hear the story of constructing the building from Dan and saw the amazing blue lighting while driving back to the farm in the night. \\n\\n3. The host Dan is friendly and thoughtful: Dan welcomed us to his place with a small bite of chocolate (of course, we are staying on a chocolate farm).  We are amazed by all his small but thoughtful surprises: champaign in the fridge (we are celebrating 2 year anniversary), some fruit juice and experimental chocolate flavor popcorn. \\n   \\n4. Chocolate farm tasting experience: we decided to go on his chocolate farm tasting tour. It was great to learn about how chocolate is made, walked around the property, and tasting some delicious chocolate. There are a cool tree house, a swinging bridge, and a river right on the property. Make sure you check that out.'}, {'_id': '415113239', 'date': datetime.datetime(2019, 2, 21, 5, 0), 'listing_id': '23926355', 'reviewer_id': '10813829', 'reviewer_name': 'Joe', 'comments': 'We had a wonderful stay at Hamakua Chocolate Farm.

Our family typically goes to Hawaii once a year, alternating between Maui and Oahu. If you're like us and want to avoid the more touristy spots like Waikiki, I would definitely recommend Ko Olina. You're away from the crowds, but still a relatively short drive (so long as you avoid commuter hours) from Honolulu and sightseeing spots. There are 4 man-made lagoons in Ko Olina. The Ko Olina Beach Villas are right at lagoon 2. Lagoon 1 has the Disney Aulani resort and I think the Four Seasons. Lagoon 3 has the Marriott and lagoon 4 is the public one, though all four lagoons are publicly accessible. We think lagoon 2 is the best, not just because it's the shortest walk from the condo (basically just down from the elevator and through the outdoor pool area), but also because it tends to be the least crowded. The lagoons are perfect for children - waters are pretty calm and don't get deep until you get pretty far out. We saw some people snorkeling, but it's not a real good spot for that. There are two towers in the Ko Olina Beach Villas. The condo is in the beach tower, which is the one closest to the beach. We've stayed at the other tower before, and while still nice, just isn't comparable to the beach tower. For the other tower, you're basically overlooking the interior of the resort and get barely, if any, a view of the ocean. The parking garage is also over the beach villa, meaning from Jackie's condo, we can take an elevator directly down to the garage (and one of the parking spots is pretty much right in front of the elevator), whereas in the other tower, you have to walk to the beach tower to take the elevator down to the parking garage. Jackie's condo also has one of the best views. It's on the penultimate floor on the side of the building where facing the empty lot where I think they will build the Atlantis resort, but you get a great view of the beach and ocean and of the sunset from the lanai. The condo has two rooms with two full bathrooms. The master is a nice size with an ensuite bathroom with a separate tub and shower. The other bedroom is smaller, especially suitable for kids. The second bathroom is just outside of the second bedroom. The condo is nicely furnished and not cluttered. Kitchen is modern. There is a smallish washer and dryer. I don't know whether the dryer was broken, but it wasn't giving out much heat. I'm sure we could have just called maintenance and they could have easily fixed, but we ended up just hang drying our clothes - they dried fast because of the weather and we helped conserve some electricity. There's plenty of towels and beach gear, including folding chairs, snorkeling gear, boogie boards and other flotation devices. There are a variety of restaurants...\"}, {'_id': '207251387', 'date': datetime.datetime(2017, 10, 28, 4, 0), 'listing_id': '5288332', 'reviewer_id': '35902824', 'reviewer_name': 'Eric', 'comments': 'Beautiful place in a great location.

Of course we did not meet him at 8 AM but at about 10 AM we went back to his apartment and he catched us infront of the room. He told us that this is maybe not the right apartment for us and that we should think about changing our apartment. It would not be usual that the people come in and go out in the middle of the night. I said that I am sorry but I did not know that we are not allowed to come and go quietly when we want to. I told him that I will change the apartment when he gives me back the money for the next nights, but he refused that option. Thus, we did not leave but just tried to come to his apartment for sleeping. He has not a respectful behavior and his flat is not very clean. The neighbourhood is friendly and nice and the location is central. I would not recommend this apartment and this host.\"}, {'_id': '14693000', 'date': datetime.datetime(2014, 6, 24, 4, 0), 'listing_id': '95560', 'reviewer_id': '8957165', 'reviewer_name': 'Hen-Wei', 'comments': 'He is really a nice to get in touch with.

Расположение. От метро идти минут 10, не меньше, и постоянно в горку. Если много вещей и чемоданы тяжелые, не очень комфортно. \\r\\n2. Квартира. В квартире сдаются 2 комнаты - эта и еще одна на одного гостя. Обстановка очень скромная, ремонта давно не было, но все очень чисто, хорошо прибрано. Нюанс - ночью слышно соседей, так как конструкция дома такова, что внутри дома - полое пространство, куда выходят вентиляционные окна из кухни. Через них слышно все. \\r\\n3. Комната. Очень маленькая. на фото выглядит как-то просторнее. Нюанс: в комнате есть окно, которое выходит на террасу. Находясь на террасе хозяин/другие постояльцы видят все, что происходит в комнате. Чтобы чувствовать себя в полной безопасности, окно необходимо закрывать. Если закрывать ночью - очень душно. \\r\\n4. Хозяин. Это самая большая проблема этой квартиры. Неприветливый, угрюмый ботаник и педант. Такое впечатление, что он просто ненавидит людей. Стращал нас правилами: мыться быстро и бесшумно, за собой все убирайте, чтобы все выглядело так, как будто вас здесь не было, не шумите, иначе с соседями будет проблема, в гости никого не водите, громко не разговаривайте, музыку не включайте. Не нравится - я могу аннулировать бронирование. И что вы улыбаетесь - я говорю что-то смешное?\\r\\nСам за все то время, что мы его видели, не улыбнулся ни разу. После многочисленных отличных отзывов о нем, было очень странно встретиться с таким человеком. В общем, мы подумали, что он вообще серийный маньяк-убийца. В другой комнате жила девочка из Канады, она была такого же мнения о хозяине - Хулиане.\\r\\nОстанавливались всего на 2 ночи, пережили. Но старались в квартире вообще не появляться, душ принимать по-минимуму, разговаривали шепотом и ходили на цыпочках. На мой взгляд, не лучший вариант в Барселоне, таком солнечном и позитивном городе.

How could the host miss this major turn around if they live there? The studio is super super small, perhaps this is the HK standard. The studio was clean, but the stairs going up up were dusty old, dirty, dark and narrow. The street stinks like garbage, because there are lots of restaurants. The kitchinette was equipded with the bare minimum: no sharp knife, no bowls, no cutting board; only one cup of water, 2 small mugs, 4 plates and some spoons, forks and blunt knifes. The water boiler was burned, fortunately we had a microwave and a rice cooker machine. No closet or wall hangers to hang clothes or jackets. The entrance of the studio is on a narrow hallway that is pilled up with stuff under plastic bags. Next time I´ll try to look for a residential area in HK, rather than commercial to avoid the stink.

I think it definitely makes up for the cons that I have mentioned. There are food shops everywhere. You can find a breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert places all on that same block.

I am not saying that these are problems,  just so you know.  The description on Air B&B was accurate.  The room was spotlessly clean, quite comfortable and very well located within easy walking distance of just about everything most of us want to do in Porto.  Even though on a street populated with bars and night clubs, it was very quiet.  Parking is EXTREMELY limited/expensive and we do not recommend that you have a car in Porto.  In my estimation, driving in Porto is nothing short of dangerous for the uninitiated.  We dropped off our rental at the Porto airport and took a taxi (20 to 30 euros) from the airport to the apartment.  We returned to the airport by taxi at the end of our stay and picked up another car to complete our trip.  Just so you know, Enterprise (operated by Guerin in Portugal) was very helpful and easy to deal with.  We made reservations in advance from the US.  Good thing because they were out of cars for people who did not have advance reservations. The kitchen in the apartment was supplied with rudimentary equipment but be sure you bring your own coffee, sugar, salt, pepper, water, wine, etc.  Stove, oven , microwave, refrigerator are there.  Supermarket for supplies was a 10 minute walk from the apartment.  Two mini-markets (which I do not recommend) were 7 minutes walk away.  AC/heater worked very well and we were comfortable all the time.  Bernardo met us at the door and was VERY helpful in directing us around the old city, arranging a taxi, etc.  He was always available at nothing short of a moment's notice.

The chocolate farm is just getting up and running but we gratefully sampled chocolates left at the side of our bed and smell the beans roasting in their workroom\\n\\nThe sea view room has a huge window that you can leave open without blinds and watch the stars. It has a private entrance and private en-suite so it's definitely more of a guest suite than a private room. You also have access to a kitchen which they use for chocolate prep. Everything is very well designed and stylish, with high end features that shout to Dan's artistic profession.\\n\\nThey even left us fresh papaya and avocados just picked from the garden for breakfast - which were so huge we couldn't possibly eat all of. \\n\\nHilo is much closer than we thought, as are waterfalls, hikes and snorkelling spots.

We love everything about the experience. Book the stay as soon as you can before this place gets too popular. Here is a quick summary of what we like about this place:  \\n1. super new&clean room with ocean-view: while we were looking for a place to stay that is close to Hilo, a lot of the hotels seen old and some Airbnbs look too remote (no bathroom attached). The cacao room really stood out as the room itself is excellent with oceanview. Already missed the feeling of waking up by the morning bird songs and enjoy the sunrise from the cacao room.\\n\\n2. Modern design farmhouse: The building is a piece of art. It is so interesting to hear the story of constructing the building from Dan and saw the amazing blue lighting while driving back to the farm in the night. \\n\\n3. The host Dan is friendly and thoughtful: Dan welcomed us to his place with a small bite of chocolate (of course, we are staying on a chocolate farm).  We are amazed by all his small but thoughtful surprises: champaign in the fridge (we are celebrating 2 year anniversary), some fruit juice and experimental chocolate flavor popcorn. \\n   \\n4. Chocolate farm tasting experience: we decided to go on his chocolate farm tasting tour. It was great to learn about how chocolate is made, walked around the property, and tasting some delicious chocolate. There are a cool tree house, a swinging bridge, and a river right on the property.

Really useful and thoughtful. \\n\\nMegan and Jason weren't around when we checked in but we were warmly greeted at the top of the stairs by their four-legged welcome crew, Frank and Bean. Real sweethearts. Never met such calm pooches before. You'll almost never hear them and there's no offensive doggy smell either. \\n\\nWe'd certainly return to Jason and Megan's if we ever visit NYC again.

The kitchen is small but has all you'll need for making breakfast, etc. Oh, and they have a fantastic shower.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location within Brooklyn could hardly be bettered, with many different subway lines all within a few minutes' easy walk, including fast lines into Manhattan and to JFK airport. The local area of Fort Greene is an excellent mix of original Brooklyn and some gentrification, making it feel like exactly the right level of 'authentic experience'. Not too full of hipsters but also very safe and serene. There were plenty of good cafes, restaurants and shops nearby for all my needs. Megan and Jason provided a list of their favourites - which was handy for my first foray out when I arrived rather tired from the flight.\\r\\n\\r\\nMegan was very helpful and friendly by email in the run up to my visit. I had a few queries about some arrangements and she answered them all speedily. I found I was a little chilly on my first night so asked for another blanket and it was provided straight away. During my stay, I bumped into both Megan and Jason almost every day and we would have a quick friendly chat. I felt like I was at home, but was also completely independent. Their dogs are friendly but mainly keep to the other room, so there wasn't any overwhelming dogginess (or any doggy smells at all!) That said, if you don't like dogs or have any allergies to animal hairs you should think twice.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, this is a lovely room with delightful hosts in a great location.

Unfortunately, I got food poisoning after eating at 67 Burger (although my partner was fine), so be warned.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur room was spacious, airy and quiet (except when there was a dinner party in the backyard), and the charming old brownstone is tastefully decorated with little curios in unexpected places.

Our family typically goes to Hawaii once a year, alternating between Maui and Oahu. If you're like us and want to avoid the more touristy spots like Waikiki, I would definitely recommend Ko Olina. You're away from the crowds, but still a relatively short drive (so long as you avoid commuter hours) from Honolulu and sightseeing spots. There are 4 man-made lagoons in Ko Olina. The Ko Olina Beach Villas are right at lagoon 2. Lagoon 1 has the Disney Aulani resort and I think the Four Seasons. Lagoon 3 has the Marriott and lagoon 4 is the public one, though all four lagoons are publicly accessible. We think lagoon 2 is the best, not just because it's the shortest walk from the condo (basically just down from the elevator and through the outdoor pool area), but also because it tends to be the least crowded. The lagoons are perfect for children - waters are pretty calm and don't get deep until you get pretty far out. We saw some people snorkeling, but it's not a real good spot for that. There are two towers in the Ko Olina Beach Villas. The condo is in the beach tower, which is the one closest to the beach. We've stayed at the other tower before, and while still nice, just isn't comparable to the beach tower. For the other tower, you're basically overlooking the interior of the resort and get barely, if any, a view of the ocean. The parking garage is also over the beach villa, meaning from Jackie's condo, we can take an elevator directly down to the garage (and one of the parking spots is pretty much right in front of the elevator), whereas in the other tower, you have to walk to the beach tower to take the elevator down to the parking garage. Jackie's condo also has one of the best views. It's on the penultimate floor on the side of the building where facing the empty lot where I think they will build the Atlantis resort, but you get a great view of the beach and ocean and of the sunset from the lanai. The condo has two rooms with two full bathrooms. The master is a nice size with an ensuite bathroom with a separate tub and shower. The other bedroom is smaller, especially suitable for kids. The second bathroom is just outside of the second bedroom. The condo is nicely furnished and not cluttered. Kitchen is modern. There is a smallish washer and dryer. I don't know whether the dryer was broken, but it wasn't giving out much heat. I'm sure we could have just called maintenance and they could have easily fixed, but we ended up just hang drying our clothes - they dried fast because of the weather and we helped conserve some electricity. There's plenty of towels and beach gear, including folding chairs, snorkeling gear, boogie boards and other flotation devices. There are a variety of restaurants...\"}, {'_id': '207251387', 'date': datetime.datetime(2017, 10, 28, 4, 0), 'listing_id': '5288332', 'reviewer_id': '35902824', 'reviewer_name': 'Eric', 'comments': 'Beautiful place in a great location.

His apartment is literally a 10 minute walk from the Sagrada Familia and two short metro stops from the center of the city.  Furthemore, there is a grocery store just around the corner of his house (buy your water here rather than at the tourist shops near the Sagrada Familia).  If you buy tickets to tour the Sagrada Familia and need to pick up your tickets from a Caixa ATM, there is one just across the street from his apartment.  The location of the flat cannot be beat! \\r\\n\\r\\nMy mom and I were in Barcelona only for 1 day, since we were leaving for a cruise the following morning.  Julian provided directions on how to take public transportation to the cruise terminals, which was incredibly easy (you just need to take 1 bus, the #20, which departs from across the street from Julian's flat, and then transfer to the cruise shuttle buses, the T3).  We were very impressed by how gracious Julian was and how much he did to accommodate us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment and the room itself are very clean.

In the first night we came home at 1 AM and 7 AM very quiet to change our clothes at our room for 10 minutes and left the apartment again. In this morning we had a message written on a piece of paper glued at the door: ''I need to talk to you 8 AM''. I felt like I would be Juliàns' little child who has to be there at 8 AM. Of course we did not meet him at 8 AM but at about 10 AM we went back to his apartment and he catched us infront of the room. He told us that this is maybe not the right apartment for us and that we should think about changing our apartment. It would not be usual that the people come in and go out in the middle of the night. I said that I am sorry but I did not know that we are not allowed to come and go quietly when we want to. I told him that I will change the apartment when he gives me back the money for the next nights, but he refused that option. Thus, we did not leave but just tried to come to his apartment for sleeping. He has not a respectful behavior and his flat is not very clean.

В квартире сдаются 2 комнаты - эта и еще одна на одного гостя. Обстановка очень скромная, ремонта давно не было, но все очень чисто, хорошо прибрано. Нюанс - ночью слышно соседей, так как конструкция дома такова, что внутри дома - полое пространство, куда выходят вентиляционные окна из кухни. Через них слышно все. \\r\\n3. Комната. Очень маленькая. на фото выглядит как-то просторнее. Нюанс: в комнате есть окно, которое выходит на террасу. Находясь на террасе хозяин/другие постояльцы видят все, что происходит в комнате. Чтобы чувствовать себя в полной безопасности, окно необходимо закрывать. Если закрывать ночью - очень душно. \\r\\n4. Хозяин. Это самая большая проблема этой квартиры. Неприветливый, угрюмый ботаник и педант. Такое впечатление, что он просто ненавидит людей. Стращал нас правилами: мыться быстро и бесшумно, за собой все убирайте, чтобы все выглядело так, как будто вас здесь не было, не шумите, иначе с соседями будет проблема, в гости никого не водите, громко не разговаривайте, музыку не включайте. Не нравится - я могу аннулировать бронирование. И что вы улыбаетесь - я говорю что-то смешное?\\r\\nСам за все то время, что мы его видели, не улыбнулся ни разу. После многочисленных отличных отзывов о нем, было очень странно встретиться с таким человеком. В общем, мы подумали, что он вообще серийный маньяк-убийца. В другой комнате жила девочка из Канады, она была такого же мнения о хозяине - Хулиане.\\r\\nОстанавливались всего на 2 ночи, пережили.

My friend couldn't even go to the toilet after 2 hours flight, and had to speak with Julian and airbnb team for one hour before leaving the apartment.\\nAs I could see from other guests comments, Julian has a lot of experience as a host and maybe my case was unique.\\nWouldn't recommend him as a host because my experience could be rated as 0 stars.\"}, {'_id': '319001956', 'date': datetime.datetime(2018, 9, 5, 4, 0), 'listing_id': '95560', 'reviewer_id': '112704794', 'reviewer_name': 'Polina', 'comments': 'Very nice area, clear room, great communication and nice tipps for the city!'}, {'_id': '319817045', 'date': datetime.datetime(2018, 9, 7, 4, 0), 'listing_id': '95560', 'reviewer_id': '80896141', 'reviewer_name': 'Theodora', 'comments': 'Excellent location.'}, {'_id': '320590503', 'date': datetime.datetime(2018, 9, 9, 4, 0), 'listing_id': '95560', 'reviewer_id': '30712031', 'reviewer_name': 'Aleksander', 'comments': 'Everything was fine, rules clearly explained, nice and quiet place in a very good location.'}, {'_id': '322848236', 'date': datetime.datetime(2018, 9, 14, 4, 0), 'listing_id': '95560', 'reviewer_id': '77632399', 'reviewer_name': 'Inan', 'comments': 'Great location and relaxed, quiet flat.'}, {'_id': '324523425', 'date': datetime.datetime(2018, 9, 17, 4, 0), 'listing_id': '95560', 'reviewer_id': '188564208', 'reviewer_name': 'Marcelo', 'comments': 'The place is very well located and he is very clean but he has so many house rules that I felt uncomfortable.
